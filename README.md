# Drum-Kit

Webpage where you can practice your drum skills.

Made as part of a section from a Udemy course I am taking.

I have added something to the project, now you can press the capital letters and still get a sound and an animation.

The webpage can be found here: https://alexmihalache99.github.io/Drum-Kit/
